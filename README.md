# Text-Based-Adventure
A text-game built in Assembly that lights up sprites on an OLED screen to display a short story with branching paths based on user input.

Input device: 2 Buttons. If possible I'd like to use more, but I don't yet know if the demands of the OLED display on the microcontroller would take away from my button usage.
I am planning on creating a text-based adventure that has branching paths of text(abstracted to a story) based on user-inputs from the buttons(abstractly their decisions in the story).
